# - Frontend development server
# - API development server
```

**Option 2: Frontend Only (For UI/component changes)**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Option 3: API Only (For backend API changes)**
```bash
# Navigate to API directory
cd api

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Start API development server
npm run dev
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Frontend Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Fix ESLint errors
npm run typecheck    # Run TypeScript checks

# Backend API
pnpm api:dev         # Start API development server
pnpm api:build       # Build API for production
pnpm api:test        # Run API tests

# Database Operations
npm run db:migrate   # Run database migrations
npm run db:reset     # Reset local database
npm run db:seed      # Seed test data

# Code Quality
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run test         # Run all tests
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Generate test coverage report

- Follow naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, UPPER_CASE)

**React:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow component naming conventions
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries

**CSS/Styling:**
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Follow design system tokens
- Use component variants over inline styles
- Ensure responsive design

**API Development:**
- Use proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Document all endpoints with examples
- Follow RESTful design principles

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- **Integration Tests**: Required for API endpoints
- **Component Tests**: Required for React components
- **E2E Tests**: Required for critical user workflows

### Testing Guidelines

**Unit Tests:**
```typescript
// Example unit test
describe('ServerManagement', () => {
  describe('updateServerFirmware', () => {
    it('should update server firmware successfully', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const serverId = 'test-server-001';
      const firmwareUrl = 'https://example.com/firmware.bin';
      
      // Act
      const result = await updateServerFirmware(serverId, firmwareUrl);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    });
  });
});
```

**Integration Tests:**
```typescript
// Example API integration test
describe('Server API', () => {
  it('should create and update server', async () => {
    // Create server
    const server = await request(app)
      .post('/api/hosts')
      .send({ hostname: 'test-server.example.com' })
      .expect(201);
    
    // Update server
    await request(app)
      .put(`/api/hosts/${server.body.data.id}`)
      .send({ hostname: 'updated-server.example.com' })
      .expect(200);
  });
});
```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

**JSDoc Comments:**
```typescript
/**
 * Updates firmware on a Dell server via iDRAC interface
 * 
 * @param serverId - Unique identifier for the target server
 * @param firmwarePackage - Firmware package containing update details
 * @param options - Configuration options for the update process
 * @returns Promise that resolves to update result with status and logs
 * 
 * @throws {ServerNotFoundError} When the specified server doesn't exist
 * @throws {FirmwareIncompatibleError} When firmware is incompatible
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await updateServerFirmware('server-001', firmwarePackage);
 * if (result.success) {
 *   console.log('Firmware updated successfully');
 * }
 * ```
 */
export async function updateServerFirmware(
  serverId: string,
  firmwarePackage: FirmwarePackage,
  options: UpdateOptions = {}
): Promise<UpdateResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```
